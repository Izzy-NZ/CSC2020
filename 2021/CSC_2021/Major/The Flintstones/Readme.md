We are given code.png, which appears to be a bunch of symbols; and gibberish.txt which upon
some testing around in cyberchef is a ROT47 encoded string which decodes to: \

Which is an image of a rock which google images identifies as a runestone. \
This clues us into the code which could be runic. \
https://www.dcode.fr/elder-futhark \
is a runic alphabet decoder and the symbols seem to match the code.png. \

This decodes to :
```
THEUIKINGS
```
Or in proper flag format:
```
flag{THEVIKINGS}
```
