We are given a video of a chess game. The game itself is fairly suspicious as neither player seems to be attempting to win. \
The file doesn't contain anything suspicious so some further research is required: \
Googling around for Steganography and Chess gives us an interesting tool that can encode data into \
a chess game and export it as a PGN. \

I didn't find any quick wins on converting an mp4 into a PGN file so I had to replay the game manually on lichess: \
